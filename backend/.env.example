# ==========================================
# CLOUD DEPLOYMENT NOTES
# ==========================================
# When deploying to Render, Heroku, or similar platforms:
# 
# 1. The live meeting bot functionality is DISABLED in cloud mode
#    because cloud platforms don't support GUI browsers (Puppeteer with display)
# 
# 2. Available features in cloud deployment:
#    - Audio file upload and transcription
#    - Zoom API integration (fetch recordings)
#    - AI analysis and task extraction
#    - Scheduled meetings
#    - All dashboard features
# 
# 3. For full bot functionality, run the backend locally
#    or on a VM with display access (e.g., AWS EC2 with VNC)
